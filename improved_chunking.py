    Josh's 18-24 month objective is to build equity in frontier AI companies. 
    He plans to use tools like LangChain, Pinecone, and GitHub in Phase 1.
    His monthly student loan payment is $2,100, with a total debt of $128,000.
    
    This is a longer paragraph that will demonstrate how the chunking works with overlapping segments.
    The overlap ensures that important information isn't lost at chunk boundaries. When we split text
    into chunks, we want to make sure that sentences aren't cut in the middle. This approach helps
    maintain context and improves search recall significantly.
    
    Another important aspect is handling different types of content. Numbers like 42, percentages like 85%,
    and dollar amounts like $50,000 should all be preserved correctly. Time periods such as 6-12 months
    should also be kept intact.
